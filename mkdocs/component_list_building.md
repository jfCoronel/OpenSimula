#### Parameters
- **azimuth** [_float_, unit = "°", default = 0, min = -180, max = 180]: Angle formed between the x-axis of the building and the east (Global x-axis). The coordinates of all building elements refer to the building coordinate system. 
- **ref_point** [_float-list_, unit = "m", default = [0,0,0]]: Three-dimensional coordinate of the building reference point (coordinates origin). All surfaces in the building will be defined relative to the building's coordinate origin.

### Space_type

#### Parameters

- **people_density** [_math_exp_, unit = "p/m²", default = "0.1"]: Occupancy density, defined in persons per m² of floor. The mathematical expression may contain any of the variables declared in the "input_variables" parameter, to be able to reflect the time variation of this value. See example below
- **people_sensible** [_float_, unit = "W/p", default = 70, min = 0]: Sensible heat generated by each of the occupants of the space.
- **people_latent** [_float_, unit = "W/p", default = 35, min = 0]: Latent heat generated by each of the occupants of the space.
- **people_radiant_fraction** [_float_, unit = "frac", default = 0.6, min = 0, max = 1]: Long wave radiant fraction of heat generated by occupants. The rest of the heat is assumed to be convective.
- **light_density** [_math_exp_, unit = "W/m²", default = "10"]: Lighting density, defined as the electrical lighting power [W] per m² of floor. The mathematical expression may contain any of the variables declared in the "input_variables" parameter, to be able to reflect the time variation of this value. See example below.

- **other_gains_radiant_fraction** [_float_, unit = "frac", default = 0.5, min = 0, max = 1]: Long wave radiant fraction of the heat generated by other gains. The convective fraction is calculated by subtracting the radiant and latent fractions.
- **other_gains_latent_fraction** [_float_, unit = "frac", default = 0.0, min = 0, max = 1]: Latent fraction of the heat generated by other gains. The convective fraction is calculated by subtracting the radiant and latent fractions.

The mathematical expression may contain any of the variables declared in the "input_variables" parameter, to be able to reflect the time variation of this value.

Assuming that the variation of occupancy, lighting and other loads has been defined in a "Year_schedule" component, named "schedule" with values between 0 and 1, the following example would capture that variation.

**Example:**
<pre><code class="python">
...

office_space = osm.components.Space_type("office_space",project)
param = {
        "input_variables": ["f = schedule.values"]

        "other_gains_density": "4.2*f",
        "other_gains_radiant_fraction": 0.6,
        "infiltration": "0.5"
