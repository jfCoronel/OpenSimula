- **nominal_cooling_conditions** [_float-list_, unit = "ºC", default = [27, 19, 35]]: Nominal cooling conditions, in order: indoor dry bulb temperature, indoor wet bulb temperature, outdoor dry bulb temperature.

### HVAC_DX_system

- **sytem_on_off** [_math_exp_, unit = "on/off", default = "1"]: If this value is 0, the system will be off, otherwise it will be on. The mathematical expression may contain any of the variables declared in the "input_variables" parameter, to be able to reflect the time variation of this value.
- **economizer** [_option_, default = "NO", options = ["NO","TEMPERATURE","TEMPERATURE_NOT_INTEGRATED","ENTHALPY","ENTHALPY_LIMITED"]]: Free cooling using outside air (economizer). If the option selected is “NO” no economizer will be used, for the other options the economizer will be used with different control strategies explained below. 
- **economizer_DT** [_float_, unit = "ºC", default = 0, min = 0]: For economizers type “TEMPERATURE” and “TEMPERATURE_NOT_INTEGRATED” set the temperature difference between the return air and the outside air at which the economizer starts to operate.
- **economizer_enthalpy_limit** [_float_, unit = "kJ/kg", default = 0, min = 0]: For economizers type ENTHALPY_LIMITED set the maximun outdoor air enthalpy at which the economizer does not operate.


__Economizer__ 

The different types of economizer operation are as follows:

* "TEMPERATURE": Temperature controlled economizer will be implemented.
* "TEMPERATURE_NOT_INTEGRATED": Temperature controlled economizer will be implemented, this economizer operates the same as the “TEMPERATURE” type but only works when the economizer is able to give the full sensible load of the space.
* "ENTHALPY": Enthalpy controlled economizer will be implemented. It works in the same way as the “TEMPERATURE” type but compares the enthalpies of the return and outside air instead of the temperatures. 
* "ENTHALPY_LIMITED": Enthalpy controlled economizer will be implemented. It works the same as the “ENTHALPY” type but compares the enthalpy of the outside air with the fixed value set in the “economizer_enthalpy_limit” parameter.

The operation of the "TEMPERATURE" economizer control_type is as follows:

* If the outdoor air temperature is higher than the room temperature minus the value of the parameter “economizer_DT”, the economizer does not operate and the outdoor air flow rate is nominal. 
* If the room has cooling load, the outdoor air temperature is lower than the room temperature minus the value of the parameter “economizer_DT", and by increasing the outside air flow rate the entire room load can be provided, the outside air flow rate will be the one required for this purpose.
* If the room has cooling load, the outdoor air temperature is lower than the room temperature minus the value of the parameter “economizer_DT", and the cooling load of the space cannot be provided only with outdoor air, then all the supply air will be outdoor and the coil will provide the remaining sensible cooling load. This mode will not work if the economizer type is “TEMPERATURE_NOT_INTEGRATED”.

#### Variables

After the simulation we will have the following variables of this component:

- __state__ [flag]: Operation of the system: off (0), heating (1), heating at maximum capacity (2), colling (-1), cooling at maximum capacity (-2), venting (3).
- __Q_sensible__ [W]: Sensible heat supplied by the coil, positive for heating and cooling.
- __Q_latent__ [W]: Latent heat supplied by the coil, positive for dehumidification.
- __Q_total__ [W]: Total heat supplied by the coil, sensible + latent. 
- __heating_setpoint__ [°C]: Heating setpoint temperature.
- __cooling_setpoint__ [°C]: Cooling setpoint temperature.
- __supply_fan_power__ [W]: Electrical power consumed by the supply fan.
- __return_fan_power__ [W]: Electrical power consumed by the supply fan.
- __m_air_flow__ [kg/s]: Dry air mass flow rate at coil inlet.       
- __outdoor_air_fraction__ [frac]: fraction of outside air in supply air.       
- __T_OA__ [ºC]: Outdoor air dry bulb temperature.
- __T_OAwb__ [ºC]: Outdoor wet bulb temperature.
- __T_MA__ [ºC]: Mixed air dry bulb temperature, at the coil inlet of the indoor unit.
- __T_MAwb__ [ºC]: Mixed air wet bulb temperature, at the coil inlet of the indoor unit.
- __F_load__ [frac]: Partial load state of the system, calculated as the thermal power 
supplied at a given instant divided by the cooling or heating capacity at the current operation conditions. Positive for heating and negative for cooling
- __T_CA__ [ºC]: Coil outlet air dry bulb temperature.
- __w_CA__ [g/kg]: Coil outlet air absolute humidity.
- __T_SA__ [ºC]: Supply air dry bulb temperature.
- __w_SA__ [g/kg]: Supply air absolute humidity.
- __T_iw__ [ºC]: Coil inlet water temperature.
- __T_ow__ [ºC]: Coil outlet water temperature.
- __T_ADP__ [ºC]: ADP (Aparatus Dew Point) temperature of the coil.
- __epsilon__ [frac]: Coil effectiveness.
- __epsilon_adp__ [frac]: Coil ADP effectiveness = 1 - Bypass Factor.
